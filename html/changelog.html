				<li class="tweak">Slimetoxin. Slimetoxin changed. Instead of pop and go slimeficiation it's now a life threatening process. Slime toxin metabolizes slowly, and deals fair bit of toxins damage. For every unit or so metabolized, it mutates one limb. Once every limb mutated, there's a 10% every tick to fully mutate into a slimegirl. If you're lucky, you might mutate right before death and that'd heal your all wounds! That' a great idea!</li>

				<li class="tweak">Atmos pumps have all had their power limits increased considerably. This means atmospherics will operate faster, but at the cost of much more power at peak performance. In addition, vents and scrubbers will operate faster when stressed, but they too will cause a tremendous power spike in a ship wide atmos contamination emergency where a huge number of scrubbers have to work hard (from a badly clogged waste line, for example). A flooded deck can also overload a deck substation, so bypass switching may be required in such cases. Beware of extreme scrubber overload!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Filter pressure limits raised to 15,000 kpa. They are still not powerful devices when pumping from low to high pressures. You should put pumps around them if you intend them to work quickly with moving pressures in a non-passive manner.</li>

				<li class="maptweak">Deck 1 - Xenoflora and Miscellaneous labs are now brighter. This should allow for scientists to actually see the things they work on. Robotics now has solid doors. Privacy windows are no longer thwarted by looking through the door-windows. Added a window to the mech bay side to compensate for the lack of visibility from that direction due to the door no longer having a window. Door to storage next to robotics actually opens for the roboticist now. Removed power cable to nowhere in deck 1 starboard fore maintenance.

With enough skill (expert+ for most things) you can run specific commands (type man for a list) to do rudimentary sysadmin diagnostic tasks. Notably, with network access, you can ssh into terminals of other computers over the network. If you are unskilled, you may get various failure effects or just be unable to do anything.</li>
