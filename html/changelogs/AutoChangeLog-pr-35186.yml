changes:
  - {tweak: CorpoOp armblades have been merged with esword code. They're now laser
      armblades and do more reliable damage.}
  - {tweak: "CorpoOp dash now automatically attacks a human target if you are holding
      a melee weapon. You still must directly click the target to dash \"at\" them,
      not the turf they're on."}
  - {bugfix: You no longer drop the RIG e-armblade and RIG e-sword due to pain or
      falling over.}
delete-after: true
