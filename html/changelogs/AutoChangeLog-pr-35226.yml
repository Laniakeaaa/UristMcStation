changes:
  - {balance: Nitrous oxide gas (anesthetic tank) sleeping effect wears off quickly
      once source of gas stopped; unlike previous behavior where it needs a very long
      time to wear off.}
  - {balance: Nitrous oxide gas does not put you to sleep reliably unless a sufficiently
      high pressure source of NO2 is constantly delivered (1ATM for anesthetic tank
      which is an O2/N2O mix)}
  - {balance: Will no longer wake patient on neural suppressor up by shaking them
      once by mistake.}
  - {bugfix: Changeling non-lethal absorb no longer puts you to sleep for 15 minutes;
      now lasts for about 40 seconds}
